# esp32-adu
ESP32 Adventure; some with TensorFlow Lite

The "adu" in the repository name is a reference to the albumn "A Deeper Understanding" by The War On Drugs bandl; taking the inspiration from this albumn to create something lasting and hopefully it inspires someone. 
Projects will be based on ESP32 and will be developed around it, featuring vast ideas and all the concepts behind those ideas.

I will also include everything I went through to develop the project so that anyone can learn from it.

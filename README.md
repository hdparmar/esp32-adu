# esp32-adu
ESP32 Adventure; some with TensorFlow Lite

The "adu" in the repository name is a reference to the albumn "A Deeper Understanding" by The War On Drugs bandl; taking the inspiration from this albumn to create something lasting and hopefully it inspires someone. 
Projects will be based on ESP32 and will be developed around it, featuring vast ideas and all the concepts behind those ideas.

I will also include everything I went through to develop the project so that anyone can learn from it.


## Overview

This project aims to develop a portable, standalone music education tool based on the ESP32-Korvo-V2 or ESP32 Dev Board. The device will serve as an interactive synthesizer and drum machine, providing a hands-on learning experience for synthesis, and audio engineering.

## Features

- **Basic Synthesizer**: Waveform generation (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth), ADSR envelope controls, and filters.
- **Drum Machine**: Simple step sequencer with preloaded drum samples.
- **Web Interface**: Real-time control via a web app hosted on the ESP32.
- **Educational Content**: Interactive lessons on music theory and synthesis.
